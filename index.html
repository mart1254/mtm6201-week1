                <p> Hello! I'm Dominic Martin. 
                    I was born on September<sup>3rd</sup>, 2000  and I am originally from 
                    Aylmer, Gatineau, <abbr title="QuÃ©bec">QC.</abbr> I moved to Ontario 
                    around 2011 and have since stayed in Ottawa and currently live in
                    Nepean near the IKEA.</p>

                <p> I enrolled in Interactive Media Design because I had originally took the Journalism 
                    course here at Algonquin and really enjoyed the technical aspects of the program but not
                    so much the actual Journalism part, and was recommended 
                    <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> by the program coordinator, but wanted to
                    try my hand at Computer Programming first because at the time I didn't really consider myself 
                    a design person. I enrolled into Computer Programming but failed Math <em>twice</em> -not a
                    a math person- and finally enrolled in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.
                    I really enjoyed first semester and hope I enjoy second semester just as much, or more.</p>
